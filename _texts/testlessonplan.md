#### Daily Instructional Lesson Plan
##### Content Area(s)/Course/Grade: 

Unit:
 
Lesson Topic: Earth’s Systems

Date:

Teacher:

School:
Standard(s):
###### (HS-ESS2-2) – Analyze geoscience data to make the claim that one change to Earth’s surface can create feedbacks that cause changes to other Earth systems. 
 

_Student Outcome(s)/Learning Target:_


_At the conclusion of this activity, students will be able to successfully identify cause-and-effect relationships as they naturally and inorganically occur. Through this process, they should also be able to predict the outcomes that certain changes to Earth’s surface may have on other related systems (e.g. coal mining causing water contamination)._ 


Context for Learning
What should the students know beforehand? How can they prep for this activity?




Instructional Delivery
Opening Activities/Motivation:
Before considering any of the included materials, students will be given the definition of coal mining and then asked to hypothesize/predict what effects coal mining may have on various Earth systems. Before given the definition, ask the students what they already know. What have they seen in the media? Do any of the students have strong opinions about it?
 
 
 
Procedures:
1) Provide students with the standard that is being covered and the definition of coal mining.
2) Ask them to hypothesize/predict the effect that they believe that coal mining may have on various Earth systems through the alteration of Earth’s surface in the Pine Mountain Settlement School region.
3) Introduce and distribute Clover Fork case study to students after explaining that the study is representative of the same county as Pine Mountain (Harlan County), so they may experience similar effects from changes to the land.
4) Have students record/mark (through annotation and notes) the effect that coal mining had on the Clover Fork region.
5) Prompt students to draw conclusions from the case study in order to revise their original predictions on the effects of coal mining (now, as it pertains to Harlan County as a whole).
6) Allow students to look at the materials that were drawn up to specifically show the effects that “mining in the petition area (Pine Mountain) will cause…”
7) Instruct students to compare their final revisions with the actual outcome that mining would have on Pine Mountain if it had taken place.
8) Require students to write a brief summary on how alterations to Earth’s surface cause its systems to change; have them move from general analysis to specifically considering Pine Mountain and Clover Fork.




Assessment/Evaluation (Formative/Summative)
Evaluation is constituted by the closure activity below (can be counted as a quiz grade if teacher sees appropriate).
 
 
Closure:
Require students to write a brief summary on how alterations to Earth’s surface cause its systems to change; have them move from general analysis to specifically considering Pine Mountain and Clover Fork.
Some relevance here would be good; Again, why should they care?
